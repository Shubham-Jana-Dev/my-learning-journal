## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 05:00 AM
**Focus:** Web Development | CSS Pseudo-Classes & Selectors

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
I created a functional demo page to master user interaction states and generated content.
* **Pseudo-Elements (`::before`, `::after`):** Used to inject visual cues (like asterisks for required fields) directly via CSS.
* **User States (`:hover`, `:active`, `:visited`):** - Implemented dynamic feedback where elements scale and change color on hover.
    - Used `:active` to simulate button presses with background shifts and border changes.
    - Styled `:visited` links to improve user navigation tracking.
* **Styling:** Applied `linear-gradient` and `border-radius` to create a modern, pill-shaped interactive button.

## 🕒 Session 2: 05:00 AM – 06:00 AM
**Focus:** Python Data Structures | Comprehensive List Drills

### 🚀 Implementation Lab
Practiced 10 essential list operations to ensure zero-friction data handling:

| Task | Method Used | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Length** | `len()` & `for` loop | Manual counting helps understand $O(n)$ complexity. |
| **Indexing** | `[0]` and `[-1]` | Negative indexing is a powerful Python shortcut. |
| **Adding** | `.append()` & `.insert()` | `append` is $O(1)$; `insert` is $O(n)$. |
| **Removing** | `.remove()` | Removes the first occurrence of a value. |
| **Extremas** | `max()` & Logic | Manual `if t < i` logic is fundamental for algorithm exams. |
| **Frequency** | `.count()` | Efficiently finds occurrences without manual loops. |
| **Reversal** | `[::-1]` | Slicing is the most "Pythonic" way to reverse. |
| **Deep Nesting**| `list[4][2][3]` | Mastered multi-level indexing in complex nested lists. |

## 🕒 Session 3: 11:00 AM – 05:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Training Block (Elgin)
* Attended full-day technical sessions at PBSSD.
* **Commuter Productivity (05:00 PM - 05:45 PM):** Utilized the bus ride to mentally recall and simulate **List Comprehension** patterns, preparing for more advanced data filtering.

## 🕒 Session 4: 07:00 PM – 10:30 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Daily Review & Refinement
* **Consolidation:** Reviewed today's classroom lessons on Database and Web Tech.
* **Refactoring:** Re-wrote morning list exercises using **List Comprehensions** to reduce code verbosity.

### 💡 Reflection
Accessing `the_list[4][2][3]` to find "Hello" was a great test of spatial logic in data structures. It mimics how we navigate JSON objects in real-world API development. On the CSS side, mastering `:before` and `:after` is a game-changer for UI design—it allows me to add decorative elements without adding unnecessary tags to my HTML.
