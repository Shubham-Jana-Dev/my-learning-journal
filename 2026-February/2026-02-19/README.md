## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 06:00 AM
**Focus:** Mathematical Logic & Algorithm Implementation (Python)

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **Geometry Solvers:**
   - Built functions to calculate area, perimeter, and properties of **Triangles**, **Squares**, and other polygons.
   - Practiced using the `math` library for precise calculations.
2. **Number Theory Problems:**
   - **Palindrome Logic:** Implemented string slicing and integer-reversal methods to check for palindromes.
   - **Armstrong Numbers:** Developed logic to calculate the sum of powers of digits to verify Armstrong properties.
   - **Utility:** Focused on writing clean, reusable code for these classic "coding interview" problems.

## 🕒 Session 2: 09:00 AM – 07:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Training (Elgin) | Web Dev & Databases

### 📝 Key Progress
- **Web Development (CSS Units):**
  - Deep dive into **Absolute vs. Relative units**. 
  - Practiced using `px`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, and `vw` for responsive layouts.
  - Learned when to use `rem` for accessibility and `vw/vh` for viewport-based scaling.
- **Database Management (SQL Kickoff):**
  - **Introduction to SQL:** Started the Database module.
  - Learned the basic structure of Relational Databases (RDBMS).
  - Practiced initial Data Definition Language (DDL) commands: `CREATE TABLE` and `DESCRIBE`.

## 🕒 Session 3: 08:00 PM – 10:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Class Revision

### 🚀 Progress Report
- **SQL Practice:** Re-ran the table creation queries from the day to solidify syntax.
- **CSS Units Lab:** Experimented with converting a fixed-pixel layout into a flexible `rem`-based layout.
- **Documentation:** Logged new SQL keywords and CSS unit behaviors into my permanent study notes.

### 💡 Reflection
Today was a big milestone: **SQL**. Moving from storing data in Python lists/files to a structured Database changes everything for my projects. I can already see how the **Book Billing System** will eventually move away from `.txt` files to a proper SQL database. Also, mastering CSS units like `rem` today makes my frontend work much more professional compared to just hardcoding `px`.
