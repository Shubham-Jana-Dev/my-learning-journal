### 💡 Reflection
Submitting the website homework today felt great. It marks the first project where I successfully combined **Responsive CSS**, **Semantic HTML**, and a logical **Database Schema** plan. I’m starting to see how all the separate PBSSD classes (Web Dev, Python, SQL) are actually part of one big engineering picture.
