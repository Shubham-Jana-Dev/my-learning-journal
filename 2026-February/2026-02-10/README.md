## 🕒 Session 4: 07:00 PM – 10:00 PM
**Focus:** Theory of Computation | Automata

### 📝 Core Concepts Explored
- **Finite Automata (FA):** Deep dive into the mathematical models of computation.
- **DFA vs. NFA:** Studied Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata.
- **State Transitions:** Practiced drawing transition diagrams and defining the 5-tuple formal definition: $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.

### 💡 Reflection
Today was a heavy "Theory" day. Moving from the creative freedom of Web Development to the rigid, mathematical logic of **Automata** requires a total shift in mindset. Automata is fascinating because it is essentially the "Grammar" of how computers think. Understanding how a machine moves from state to state based on input is giving me a new perspective on how my C and Python code is actually interpreted at a lower level.
