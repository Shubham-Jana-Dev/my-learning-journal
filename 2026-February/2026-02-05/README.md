## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 06:00 AM
**Focus:** Binary Search Implementation in C++ (Iterative vs. Recursive)

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **Iterative Binary Search (`BinaryS`)**:
   - Implemented standard while-loop logic.
   - Used `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent overflow.
2. **Recursive Binary Search (`BinarySearch_througnh_function`)**:
   - Built a clean recursive version using the function call stack.
   - Handled base cases for "Element Found" and "Not Found" logic.
3. **Array Manipulation**:
   - Created a utility `findTheSecondLastElement` to practice index targeting.

**Working Area:** [Basic.cpp](https://github.com/Shubham-Jana-Dev/Learning-by-myself/blob/main/Basic.cpp)

## 🕒 Session 2: 11:00 AM – 03:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Web Dev (Frontend) & DAA Theory (Day 17)

### 📝 DAA Deep Dive: Big O Notation Formalism
Refined the mathematical understanding of asymptotic analysis.

**Core Definition:**
Assuming $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are non-negative functions:
$$f(n) = O(g(n)) \iff f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n) \text{ for all } n \geq n_0$$
*Where $c$ and $n_0$ are constants.*

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Tight Upper Bound:** $g(n)$ represents the worst-case growth rate for $f(n)$.
* **Asymptotic Growth:** After a specific point $n_0$, the function $g(n)$ scaled by $c$ will always stay above $f(n)$.

## 🕒 Session 3: 03:00 PM – 05:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Web Dev (Backend)
- Continued backend architectural training and server-side logic.

## 🕒 Session 4: 07:00 PM – 11:00 PM
**Focus:** "Hardcore" Web Challenge (Notepad Development)

### 🚀 Challenge Progress
- **Constraints:** Building a complete web page from scratch using only **Notepad** (no VS Code, no AI assistance, no Prettier).
- **Goal:** To test mental muscle memory for HTML tags, CSS properties, and layout logic.
- **Progress:** Successfully structured the page and started styling the UI components manually.

### 💡 Reflection
Today was a true test of versatility. I moved from the rigid mathematical proofs of **Big O Notation** to the manual "no-safety-net" coding of the web challenge. Coding in Notepad is frustrating but incredibly effective for identifying where my knowledge of syntax has gaps. In C++, seeing the iterative and recursive binary search side-by-side helped solidify how the logic remains identical even when the implementation pattern changes.
