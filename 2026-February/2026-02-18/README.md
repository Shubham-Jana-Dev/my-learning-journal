### 💡 Reflection
Today's focus on **DAA** with Neso Academy was incredibly helpful for visualizing how algorithms scale. Combining that theoretical "math-heavy" morning with a long evening of **Lecture Reviews** ensures that I'm not just attending classes, but actually absorbing the material. The Python revision in the early morning keeps my "coding hands" warm while I focus on the "theory brain" for the rest of the day.
