## 🕒 Session 3: 09:00 AM – 07:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Training (Elgin) | UI/UX & Database Design

  - Practiced `text-transform` (uppercase/lowercase) and `letter-spacing` to improve typography readability.

## 🕒 Session 4: 08:00 PM – 10:00 PM
**Focus:** PBSSD Revision & Implementation

### 🚀 Progress Report
- **Modeling Practice:** Sketched a preliminary E.R. diagram for the "Book Billing System" to identify primary keys and foreign key relationships.
- **CSS Typography Lab:** Applied the new text decoration styles to the project's landing page to enhance the visual hierarchy.
- **Query Drills:** Re-practiced SQL queries to ensure zero-syntax errors in the MySQL CLI.

### 💡 Reflection
The jump from writing SQL queries to drawing **E.R. Diagrams** was a crucial shift today. It taught me that building a database isn't just about coding tables; it's about **designing the logic** behind how data pieces connect. Combining this with the typography lessons from the CSS class, I’m realizing that the "Frontend" (Text Decoration) and the "Backend" (E.R. Diagrams) are two sides of the same coin when building a professional application.
