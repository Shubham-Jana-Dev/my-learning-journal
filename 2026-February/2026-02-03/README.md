## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 07:00 AM
**Focus:** C++ Fundamentals & Mathematical Logic

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - Implemented **Factorial** using a recursive approach (Function 1).
   - Implemented **Factorial** using an iterative `for` loop (Function 2) for $O(1)$ space efficiency.
2. **C++ Data Literals:**
   - Practiced precision control using suffixes: `f` for `float` and `l` for `long double`.
3. **Reference Variables:**
   - Experimented with memory aliasing using `float &mil = div;`.
4. **Explicit Typecasting:**
   - Used `(int)` to manually convert floating-point values to integers.

## 🕒 Session 4: 08:00 PM – 12:10 AM
**Focus:** Collaborative Development | Book Billing System (POS)

### 🚀 Progress Report
- Started a collaborative project with a peer to build a robust **Library/Book Billing Platform**.
- **Key Focus:** Building the logic for a Point of Sale (POS) system using C++.
- **Collaboration:** Managing version control and feature integration via GitHub.

**Project Repository:** [Book-billing-system](https://github.com/Shubham-Jana-Dev/Book-billing-system)

### 💡 Reflection
Moving from standalone snippets to a **collaborative project** feels like a major milestone. Understanding **Reference Variables** this morning was perfect timing, as they are crucial for passing large data structures (like book inventory objects) efficiently in our billing system. I am finding that C++ is much more powerful for building these kinds of systems than C.
