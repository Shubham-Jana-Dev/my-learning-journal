## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 06:00 AM
**Focus:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **Understanding the Class:** - Studied the concept of a `class` as a blueprint for creating objects.
   - Practiced defining attributes (data) and methods (behavior) within a class scope.
2. **Encapsulation:** - Explored the principle of wrapping data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit.
   - Learned about access modifiers and how encapsulation protects the internal state of an object from unintended interference.

## 🕒 Session 3: 07:00 PM – 10:00 PM
**Focus:** Communication Assignment

### 📝 Assignment Details
- Worked on the university communication module.
- Focused on technical writing and professional correspondence, bridging the gap between coding skills and professional workplace requirements.

### 💡 Reflection
Starting **OOP** today feels like a "level up." Until now, my code was mostly procedural (step-by-step), but **Encapsulation** allows me to think of my projects—like the Book Billing System—as a collection of interacting objects (Books, Customers, Bills). This will make my code much easier to scale and debug for the Tech Fest project.
