## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 07:00 AM
**Focus:** Python Problem Solving

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
- Refined logic for complex data manipulation challenges.
- Focused on utilizing **List Comprehensions** and **Lambda functions** to write more concise, "Pythonic" code.
- Debugged edge cases in recursive functions to prevent stack overflow errors.

## 🕒 Session 2: 10:00 AM – 03:30 PM
**Focus:** University Academic Block
- Attended scheduled B.Tech CSE lectures.
- Participated in lab sessions focusing on core semester concepts.

---

## 🕒 Session 3: 05:00 PM – 07:00 PM
**Focus:** University Tech Fest Project Development

### 🚀 Progress Report
- **Backend Logic:** Developed the initial functional modules for the Tech Fest project.
- **Workflow Design:** Mapped out the data flow between user input and the processing engine.
- **Problem Identification:** Identified specific UI/UX bottlenecks that need to be addressed in the next web development session.

## 🕒 Session 4: 07:00 PM – 10:00 PM
**Focus:** University Curriculum Study
- Conducted a deep review of lecture notes to solidify the day's academic learning.
- Prepared for upcoming internal assessments by solving textbook problems.

### 💡 Reflection
The early morning sessions are proving to be the most productive for "Heavy Logic" work. Applying the Python problem-solving techniques directly to the **Tech Fest project** later in the day creates a great feedback loop. It's becoming clear that the time spent on fundamental Python exercises is significantly reducing the time it takes to build actual project features.
