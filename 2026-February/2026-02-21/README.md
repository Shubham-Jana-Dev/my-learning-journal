## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 07:00 AM
**Focus:** SQL Practice & Logic Refinement

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Practiced `INSERT INTO` statements to populate the tables created earlier in the week.
- **Querying Basics:** Experimented with `SELECT` statements, including the `WHERE` clause for filtered data retrieval.
- **Constraints:** Learned about `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `PRIMARY KEY` constraints to ensure data integrity at the database level.

### 💡 Reflection
Finishing this week feels productive. The transition from pure Python logic to **MySQL** and **E.R. Diagrams** has added a "System Design" layer to my thinking. I’m no longer just writing code; I’m building a structured environment where data has a clear home. The "Soft Skills" and "English Listening" sessions from earlier in the week are also giving me more confidence in documenting my progress clearly.
