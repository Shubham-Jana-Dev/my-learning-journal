## 🎯 Focus: Search Algorithm Efficiency
Today's session was dedicated to the mathematical proof of $O(\log n)$ and visualizing how binary search outperforms linear search as datasets grow.

### 📝 Topics Covered
* **Binary Search Logic:** The "divide and conquer" approach.
* **Math Derivation:** Proving $k = \log_2 n$ via algebraic steps.
* **Complexity Mapping:** Comparing $O(n)$ vs $O(\log n)$ growth rates.

**Reflections:** The gap between 100 items and 1 billion items is massive, but for binary search, it's only a difference of 23 comparisons (7 vs 30). Math is powerful.
