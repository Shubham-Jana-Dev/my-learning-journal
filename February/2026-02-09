## 🕒 Session 1: 04:00 AM – 07:00 AM
**Focus:** Python Persistence & Library Infrastructure

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **File Handling Deep Dive:**
   - Mastered the `open()` function across multiple modes: `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, and `'r+'`.
   - Implemented **Context Managers** using the `with` statement to handle file streams safely and prevent memory leaks.
2. **Library & Module Architecture:**
   - Explored the `import` system, including aliasing (`import as`) and specific member imports (`from ... import`).
   - Studied how the Python interpreter locates modules via `sys.path`.

## 🕒 Session 3: Evening Block
**Focus:** University Tech Fest Project | Initial Phase

### 🚀 Progress Report
- **Project Initiation:** Started the architectural design for the upcoming University Tech Fest.
- **System Logic:** Integrating persistent storage concepts (File I/O) learned this morning to ensure data remains consistent between sessions.
- **Resource Planning:** Mapping out the necessary Python libraries required for the project's core functionality.

### 💡 Reflection
File handling is the missing piece for making my applications "real." Without persistence, the **Book Billing System** is just a calculator; with it, it becomes a database. Today's deep dive into `with` blocks showed me how to write cleaner, more professional code. Balancing this with Soft Skills training is crucial because the best code in the world won't win a Tech Fest if I can't communicate its impact.
